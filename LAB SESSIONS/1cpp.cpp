/*
An important standard library is iostreams, which allow you to read
from files and the keyboard, and to write to files and the display.

The preprocessor will find the iostream header file (often in a
subdirectory called “include”) and insert it.

Do you when stdio.h is callled in a C Program and who calls it?

****The complier will first convert the code to INDIVIDUAL OBJECT CODE
then the LINKER will link all these object codes.Then another software Loder will now convert to exe where the code will be executed.
The program is always executed in sequencial manner****

The operator cout is an object
Belongs to output stream class (o stream)
Used to perform write operations on the output devices e.g. screen, disk etc.
Used with left shift operator (<<), called insertion or put-to operator or output
operator
Syntax
cout « "variable";
Variable may be built in data type/string/constant/blank character
It also supports cascaded output operations
Does not require explicit Format specification (unlike printf that needs “string”)

The operator cin is an object
Belongs to input stream class (i stream)
Used to perform read operations from the input devices e.g. keyboard
Used with right shift operator (>>), called extraction / get /input operator
Syntax

Variable may be built in data type/string/blank character
It should have at least one argument
It also supports cascaded input operations
Does not require explicit Format specification (unlike scanff that needs “string”)
